            <h1>Software Development</h1>
            <p>Software development involves creating and maintaining applications for various devices and purposes.
                It's a complex process requiring skills in problem analysis, solution design, coding, and testing.
                Collaboration with team members like project managers and designers is also crucial.

                There are several types of software, each with its own challenges and processes.
                Desktop applications, installed and run on computers, are often used for tasks like word processing. Web applications, accessed via a browser, are commonly used for online shopping or banking. Mobile applications, designed for smartphones or tablets, are typically used for checking email or playing games. Lastly, embedded system software, designed for microcontrollers and microprocessors, is often found in devices like cars or airplanes.
